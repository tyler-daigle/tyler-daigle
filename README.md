# Hello There

My name is Tyler and I am a web developer who enjoys creating interesting
things using Vue.js and JavaScript.

## Some things I have made

  - [A budget predictor app](https://github.com/tyler-daigle/budget-predictor) using Vue.
  - [A Fallout Password Hacking Game](https://github.com/tyler-daigle/fallout-game).
  - [An Amateur Radio Exam Creator](https://github.com/tyler-daigle/ham-exam-fe).
  - [A Countdown to Halloween Badge Creator](https://github.com/tyler-daigle/halloween-countdown).

## Some things about me

  - 👻 I am a huge horror fan and would love to have a job that has something to do with horror (podcasts, websites, movies, etc).
  - 🐈‍⬛ I have one black cat.
  - 🎮 I started programming in C because I wanted to be a game programmer.
  - 🎃 Halloween is my favorite time of the year.
  - 🤦‍♂️ I once created a Tetris clone in python (with sounds and everything) that worked great... but I somehow managed to delete the entire codebase.
